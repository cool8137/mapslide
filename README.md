# MapSlide

MapSlide is an open system for landslide mapping, documentation, data analysis and risk/susceptibility information system. It is composed of various components including web app, mobile app, MediaWiki etc. 

Users can use the web/mobile app to map location and information regarding any landslide event like time, type, size, etc. The information is uploaded and documented automatically to landslide wiki. We believe that every landslide is special, so every landslide will have a dedicated wiki page where users can do further discussions on the landslide event.

All of the data stored in the system can be used to develop better landslide prediction models.

MapSlide also consists of a risk information system. In this prototype we employ a simple landslide warning system for Nepal based on the rainfall thresholds for landslides given by Dahal and Hasegawa (2008). Based on user's location and the corresponding realtime rainfall data (TRMM), user can be informed whenever the rainfall threshold is exceeded. In future development, other sophisticated prediction models that include other features like slope, elevation, drainage density, etc. can also be employed.

The users of this system can be composed of people from variety of fields including technical experts and students.

Another main reason behind the introduction of mobile app is to bring in as many non technical users, particularly the student enthusiasts, and instill in them a sense of involvement in a social-cum-scientific cause. The app also would display information obtained from analysis back to the user. Also, this can pave way to developing systems to include incident other than landslides.
